The dashboard presents the following key findings:

- Spring had the most absences.
- Spring had the highest workload.
- 5 employees (of 36) accounted for half of all absences.
- Medical reasons were the most common cause of absences.
- Drinkers took the most unjustified leave (70%).
- Absences due to medical reasons (Reason 15) occurred only on Mondays and Fridays.
- Employees with 4 children took more leave than those with fewer children.
- Obese employees, constituting a quarter of the workforce, accounted for a third of all medical leave.

## Conclusions
Based on the analysis, the following conclusions were drawn:

- Spring workload needs adjustment or redistribution.
- Employees with high absenteeism need additional support and engagement.
- Initiatives such as health-focused events and office remodeling can promote healthier lifestyles.
- Strategies to discourage heavy drinking are recommended.
- Employees with 4 children may benefit from additional support, such as childcare services.

## Recommendations
The following recommendations are proposed:

1. Adjust or distribute workload during Spring.
2. Provide support and engagement for employees with high absenteeism.
3. Implement initiatives promoting healthy lifestyles and consider office remodeling.
4. Develop strategies to discourage heavy drinking.
5. Provide additional support, such as childcare, for employees with 4 children.
